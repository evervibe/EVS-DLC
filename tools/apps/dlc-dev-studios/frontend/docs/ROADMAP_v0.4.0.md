## API Requirements

The v0.4.0 frontend will require the following backend endpoints:

### Authentication Endpoints
- `POST /auth/login` - User login
- `POST /auth/register` - User registration
- `POST /auth/logout` - User logout
- `POST /auth/refresh` - Token refresh
- `POST /auth/forgot-password` - Password reset request
- `POST /auth/reset-password` - Password reset confirmation
- `GET /auth/me` - Get current user

### User Management Endpoints
- `GET /users` - List users (admin only)
- `GET /users/:id` - Get user details
- `POST /users` - Create user (admin only)
- `PUT /users/:id` - Update user
- `DELETE /users/:id` - Delete user (admin only)
- `PUT /users/:id/role` - Change user role (admin only)

### Permission Endpoints
- `GET /permissions` - List all permissions
- `GET /roles` - List all roles
- `GET /roles/:id/permissions` - Get role permissions

## Migration Strategy

### Breaking Changes
- Authentication will be required for all routes (except login/register)
- Old API client will be replaced with authenticated version
- Some routes may require role-based permissions

### Migration Steps
1. Update backend to support authentication endpoints
2. Implement auth context and protected routes
3. Update all API calls to include auth tokens
4. Add permission checks to UI components
5. Update documentation
6. Test all user flows

## Timeline

|-------|----------|----------|
| **Phase 1: Foundation** | 2 weeks | Auth system, login/register, JWT |
| **Phase 2: RBAC** | 2 weeks | Roles, permissions, user management |
| **Phase 3: Security** | 1 week | Security enhancements, audit logging |
| **Phase 4: Tools** | 2 weeks | Search, compare, export, import |
| **Phase 5: UX** | 1 week | UI improvements, notifications |
| **Phase 6: Testing** | 1 week | Tests, accessibility, bug fixes |
| **Total** | **9 weeks** | |

## Success Criteria

v0.4.0 will be considered complete when:

- ✅ Users can register, login, and logout
- ✅ Role-based access control is implemented
- ✅ All data operations are protected by permissions
- ✅ User management interface is functional
- ✅ Security best practices are implemented
- ✅ Developer tools are fully functional
- ✅ Test coverage is >80%
- ✅ Documentation is updated

## Dependencies

### Frontend
- Authentication library (e.g., `@tanstack/react-query` for auth state)
- Form validation (already have `react-hook-form`)
- Toast notifications (new dependency needed)

### Backend
- JWT library for token generation
- Password hashing (bcrypt)
- Email service for password reset
- Role/permission database tables

## Risks & Mitigation

| Risk | Impact | Mitigation |
|------|--------|------------|
| Breaking existing functionality | High | Comprehensive testing, feature flags |
| Backend delays | Medium | Mock API endpoints, parallel development |
| Security vulnerabilities | High | Security audit, penetration testing |
| Performance degradation | Medium | Performance testing, optimization |
